# What is this progect about?

### I wanted to use Flask and a Weather API to create a website where users can retrieve information from the EUROPEAN CLIMATE ASSESSMENT & DATASET (ECA&D).

### This is the blended series of stations around Europe.

#### URL format: http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/v1/station/date

URL Example for one station for one date: http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/v1/10/1988-10-25

URL Example for one station for all dates: http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/v1/10

URL Example for one station for a specific year: http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/v1/yearly/10/1988
### Enjoy!
